# Workspace
Hello World, the above repo is a collection of my works that I see as a sort of portfolio.

My name is Clark.  I develop computer games and android apps.  My favorite languages are Java, C#, C++, and PHP.  I am currently learning data structures, algorithms, and experimenting with Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 5.

My primary interests are in Multiplayer Computer Games, Role-Playing, Strategy, Competitive, and Fantasy/Sci-Fi.  I believe video games are an all-encompassing form of art, from the graphics, music, and gameplay--to the stories, characters, and unique elements that make each game special to us.

I would love to collaborate with other developer(s) on a project or idea.
I would really Love to be a part of a team of game developers.
But most of all, I love that I have the opportunity to do what I love everyday.
