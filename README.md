My Life in Software Development Thus Far

Hello World!  This Repository is a Collection of All My Work. 
Please, Feel Free to Critique!
I hope to utilize it as a sort of portfolio.

Below is a little life story about me, for anyone who may be interested.

Hi, My name is Clark, and on February 22, 2016 I decided to begin taking programming seriously, very seriously.

My journey began back in 2009 in C++, I soon moved into HTML/CSS then PHP/SQL and finally to Javascript.  I soon gave up programming and forgot about it, as I had to work a "real job" to pay for my "real life".

Fast forward to 2014, I enrolled in community college for computer science and began to learn Java, C#, Unity, and Unreal Engine.  By the end of my 3rd semester however, "real life" came calling, and once again I had to put off my studies to make ends meet.

However, since February 22, 2016, I have forgone any luxury in life to focus solely on that which I am truly passionate about, game development.  Currently I spend 12+ hours a day honing my craft, I am determined to get to where I want to be in life, and I know how to get their through Java.  

Though it is still early in my journey, today I feel competitent to take on a role as a Junior Developer, and at that my skills grow daily, so it will not be long until I begin to free-lance and contract myself with, or without traditional employment.

I am primarily interested in Game Development, Desktop Applications, Android Development, and Networking Applications.
I understand J2EE or Java EE and Web Applications are the sure-fire path to employment, and I am learning them as well.

I have long-term dreams of building a game development studio focused on multiplayer tactic/strategy, role-playing, and rogue-like titles.

I can be a little shy at times, but I would really enjoy meeting fellow developers, especially those looking to mentor, or be mentored, as my primary passion in life is learning.
I would also love the opportunity to collaborate with other developer(s) on any project(s) or idea(s) you may have, feel free to reach out to me any time, I won't bite I promise!
